# Survival game made in Unity (C#)
 
- the goal of the game is for the player to survive as long as possible by collecting points by killing enemies or destroying various objects placed on the map

- objects and enemies are randomly instantiated on the map at the start of the game

- the enemies have their own behavior, randomly walking around the map, and when we get into their range, they start attacking us (NavMeshAgent)
